        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          RoomRental was born out of a need to simplify the room-hunting
          process. We noticed how difficult it was for people to find reliable
          and budget-friendly accommodationsâ€”so we decided to change that.
          Today, we connect thousands of room seekers with verified listings in
          just a few clicks.

        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Our mission is to create a seamless and secure platform that bridges
          the gap between landlords and tenants. We aim to provide a wide
          selection of rooms, transparent pricing, and real-time availability to
          make renting easier than ever.
